# FILE-SYSTEM-ORGAINSER-
IT ARRANGES ALL TYPES OF FILE ACCORDING TO ITS FILE EXTENSION IN ITS RESPECTIVE FOLDER .

WE ALL HAVE A FOLDER WHICH HAS MANY FILES AND WHEN WE NEED ANY SPECIFIC FILE WE SEARCH IT BY NAME 
BUT DUE TO LOT OF FILES AND SLOW SYSTEM IT TAKES LOT OF TIME . 
SO AFTER ARRANGING ALL FILE IN ITS RESPECTIVE FOLDERS LIKE (.pdf,.docx in DOCUMENTS .mp4 in VIDEOS)
SO BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FILE WE ARE INCREASING OUR SEARCH SPEED 

AND ALSO ARRANGING ALL THE FILES IN EASIEST WAY .
